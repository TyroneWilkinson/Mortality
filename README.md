Exploratory Visualization and Shiny Project

For this project, I am required to build an interactive Shiny application that can create visual representations of data insights and trends.
I focus on the leading causes of mortality by US county and identify trends from 1980-2014.

Please utilize the .RDS files in data folder. Instructions are stated in the global.R file. Else, the .CSV files can be downloaded from data source.
